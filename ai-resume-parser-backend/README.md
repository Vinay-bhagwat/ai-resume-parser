# AI Resume Parser Backend Service

This service provides AI-powered resume parsing capabilities using OpenAI or Google's Gemini models.

## Quick Start with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- OpenAI API key and/or Google API key

### Running the Container

1. Pull and run the container:
```bash
docker run -d 
  -p 3000:3000 
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key 
  -e GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key 
  -e DEFAULT_AI_PROVIDER=openai 
  --name resume-parser 
  your-registry/ai-resume-parser-backend:latest
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | Your OpenAI API key | Yes (if using OpenAI) | - |
| GOOGLE_API_KEY | Your Google API key | Yes (if using Gemini) | - |
| DEFAULT_AI_PROVIDER | AI provider to use (openai/gemini) | No | openai |
| PORT | Port to run the service on | No | 3000 |
| NODE_ENV | Node environment | No | production |

### API Endpoints

#### Parse Resume
- **POST** `/api/resume-parser/parse`
- **Content-Type**: application/json
- **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "content": "Resume text content here...",
  "provider": "openai" // or "gemini", optional
}
```

#### Health Check
- **GET** `/health`
- Returns 200 OK if service is healthy

### Building the Image Locally

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-resume-parser/ai-resume-parser-backend
```

2. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t ai-resume-parser-backend .
```

3. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -d 
  -p 3000:3000 
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key 
  -e GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key 
  --name resume-parser 
  ai-resume-parser-backend
```

### Security Features
- Runs as non-root user
- Uses multi-stage build for smaller image size
- Contains health check endpoint
- Production-only dependencies in final image

### Monitoring
The service includes a health check endpoint that can be used with container orchestration platforms.

### Troubleshooting
1. Check logs:
```bash
docker logs resume-parser
```

2. Check health status:
```bash
docker inspect resume-parser | grep Health
```

3. Access the container:
```bash
docker exec -it resume-parser sh
```
